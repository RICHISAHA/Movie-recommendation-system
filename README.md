# Movie-recommendation-system

There are three types of recommender systems. 

#### Demographic filtering

This system recommends movies to a user based on the movie's general popularoty among the audience.

#### Content based reommender

Content based recommendation system suggests movies to a user based on the user's likes and tastes in the subitems like the director, genre, actors etc.

#### Collaborative filtering

This type of recommendation system compares people having similar interests and recommends movie according to this comparison.


#### Here in this project, I have created a content based movie recommendation system using python libraries such as numpy, pandas and scikit-learn.
